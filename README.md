# micamviewer


Fourth year design project where we built an ambisonic mic (tetrahedral arrangment) and mounted a 360 degree camera on it. After processing the audio in matlab, we were able to make an iOS app which allowed the user to swipe through the video to view the area they were interested in, and in real time it would adjust the audio to isolate the sounds coming from the direction they were viewing.
